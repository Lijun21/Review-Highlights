I'm not typically a shiu mai kinda guy, but the idea of an authentic lamb shiu mai intrigued me.,
Intrigued = must try.,
And what a splendid surprise!,
It is much reminiscent of a soup dumpling in its steamy goodness, with a succulent juicy inside wrapped around a flour wrapper with the perfect amount of tact.,
